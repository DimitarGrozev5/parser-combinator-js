# parser-combinator-js

This project follows an article writend by Scott Wlaschin
https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/series/understanding-parser-combinators/

The code in the article is originaly writen in F#. I atempted to rewrite it in JavaScript, while preserving as much as possible the quirks and features of F#.
